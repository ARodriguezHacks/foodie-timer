# Plain JS Pomodoro Clock

What will this project do?

Create a Pomodoro Clock clone. 

A pomodoro clock is a timer app. It is typically set to 25 minutes after which the timer stops and then you would take a 5 or 10 minute break and resume working for another 25 minutes. It's a time management tool and thus has become popular for beginner programmers as a first-time project.

This pomodoro clock app will need:

-A friendly user interface
-No routes
-DOM manipulation thus JavaScript

When a user lands on the website, the user will be greeted by text that explains briefly what the app does and how to use it. 

The app will show a timer already set to 25 minutes and a start button at minimum. Additional buttons subject to appear.

When the user clicks on the start button, the timer will start counting down. This will require an event listener so that after every second, the timer goes down. When it reaches zero, the timer will stop and then alert the user in some way. This will either be by a noise or an alert box or something.

Steps:

1. Create a basic sketch/mock-up for how the app should look. Research how other pomodoro apps look like
2. Figure out the functionality:
  - Before a user starts the timer, ask them to choose an image.
